# UnityShader

a seriers of learning shaders / scripts aim to learn the rendering pipeline of Unity
forward, deferred, shadows, translucent ...

There are a lot of shader in the repository. They are created for the purpos of understanding Unity/ general commercial engine rendering pipeline.

To refer the original tutorial
catLikeCoding

My version is a little bit different from place to place as these are my way of understanding the rendering.

To use this package,
create a Unity project in your local drive, clone the repository and overwrite the asset folder with the repository.

Also, along the process of writiting these shader I write a Unity rendering cookbook. 
This cookbook provide a quick reference for solving a common problem like:
how to create vertex light
how to create reflection
how to do transparent shadow
...

It also provides some explaination of Unity background work like:

How Unity handel postprocess
How Unity do defer rendering

The cookbook might be helpful to the ones who is learning Unity shader, I put the googledoc link here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e8QrC7O2QIXjDiG8zIQbFDn7qBQOmDhwqsVZnDHhrRU/edit?usp=sharing

The cook book is still WIP so there might be some inaccuracy.
